# Library-Management-System
This is my first complete program

# What is this?
This is my first attempt making a program with C#.
Maybe it useless for you but you can get it to practice a litter skill.

# How do I compile this if I want to use it, even though it is completely useless?
I suggest you just open the .sln solution file in Visual Studio and it will auto-compile the project for you. ðŸ˜‰
After that you need attach .mdb file from database folder to your SQL sever and replace all connection from my code to run program. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

# Why is it not an unlicense this time?
Because I actually spent time and effort into this one ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤£ so, similar to a few of my PowerShell repositories, 
please credit me when referencing, sharing, or doing something with this at the right times ðŸ˜”. Please ðŸ˜¥.

# Conclusion...
Have fun with this useless project! ðŸ˜ƒ

One more thing: If you click read or delete when there is no saved note, there will be an error, as there is no note to read or delete. 
Idk how do fix, so please ignore ðŸ˜”.
